\section{Conclusions}
The parallel implementation of the median filter application significantly outperformed the sequential implementation. Image operations involving simple instructions executed on multiple sets of data seem suited to threaded implementations. Careful management of data accesses led to significant performance improvements, suggesting that a parallelism does not necessarily outweigh the improvements that can be made through improving the sequential algorithm.
