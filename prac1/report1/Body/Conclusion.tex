\section{Conclusions}
The experiments performed served to confirm the expectations of how correlation of two sinusoids would be affected by sample-based shifts. Further research on this topic can be done, to clarify some points regarding time-based vs sample-based shifting of signals. This report also served to confirm that a custom implementation of the white noise generation algorithm failed to surpass the performance of the native implementation.
