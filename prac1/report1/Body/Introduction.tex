\section{Introduction}

This report aims to cover the variance in performance between native Octave algorithms and a custom implementation of them, with comparison of their relative performances. The algorithms in question are noise generation and correlation.

Correlating two signals that are identical in shape but differing in phase/time introduces new questions to be considered: will the two signals still show perfect correlation? How will the correlation coefficient be affected by a shift in time, and how drastically? Does the sample rate of the signal have an effect?
